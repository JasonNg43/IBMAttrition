# IBM_Attrition_Analysis_Project
This is a Tableau dashboard with filter to analyze overtime work, compensation and management impact as part of IBM project in solving 2024 LA office's Attrition Problem. The company has faced recent challenges related to workforce management, including layoffs, talent retention, and employee dissatisfaction. IBM has been restructuring its workforce by offshoring roles to India and laying off senior employees in the U.S., particularly those in levels L7–L9 who are between 50–55 years old and at the top of the pay scale. ​​To address these challenges, the following data and features will be analyzed:
Employee Demographics:Age, Education, Marital Status, Job Level, Job Role.
Job-Related Features:Department, Years at Company, Years in Current Role, Total Working Years.
Compensation Metrics: Hourly Rate, Monthly Income, Monthly Rate
Satisfaction Metrics: Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction.
Workforce Logistics: Business Travel, Distance from Home.
Attrition: Binary target variable indicating whether an employee has left the organization (Yes/No).


- Rationale: these three factors theoretically can be controlled by the company as independent variables
- Scenarios will be more granular in level of departments and job roles to provide insights
- Environment, job and relationship satisfaction will be reported as scenario outcome alongside attrition to quantify impact
